6.25 This question asks you to transform a loop with a break statment into one without. Pasecal has no break statment.

Consider a mid-test loop, here written in C, that looks for blank lines in its input:
 for (;;) {
  line = read_line();
 if (all_blanks(line)) break;
 consume_line(line);
 }
Show how you might accomplish the same task using a while or do (repeat) loop, if mid-test loops were not available. 
(Hint: One alternative duplicates part of the code; another introduces a Boolean flag variable.) How do these 
alternatives compare to the mid-test version?

var
  line: string;
  allBlanks: boolean;

allBlanks := false;
while not allBlanks do
begin
  line := read_line();
  allBlanks := all_blanks(line);
  if not allBlanks then
    consume_line(line);
end;

The boolean flag might be considered more readable and easier to understand because it explicitly states the condition for continuation.

6.26 This question asks you to transform a nested loop with a goto statment into one without. Java has no goto statment.

Rubin [Rub87] used the following example (rewritten here in C) to argue in favor of a goto statement:
 int first_zero_row = -1; /* none */
 int i, j;
 for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
   if (A[i][j]) goto next;
  }
  first_zero_row = i;
  break;
 next: ;
 }
The intent of the code is to find the first all-zero row, if any, of an n × n matrix. 
Do you find the example convincing? Is there a good structured alternative in C? In any language?

int firstZeroRow = -1; //none

outerLoop:
for (int i = 0; i < n && firstZeroRow == -1; i++) {
  boolean allZeros = true; // Assume all zeros in the row

  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    if (A[i][j] != 0) {
      allZeros = false; // Set to false if non-zero element is found
      break;
    }
  }

  if (allZeros) {
    firstZeroRow = i;
    break outerLoop; // exit outer loop if zero row if found
  }
}
